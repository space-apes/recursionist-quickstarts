## Django Quickstart
This quickstart output guide will cover all of the necessary knowledge to begin building applications in Django, a Python-based back-end web framework that emphasizes ease of  development but is also powerful enough to be the basis of large projects like Instagram and the Mozilla website. In its most common use-case, Django would be used to create web applications that are driven by Python logic to interact with data from persistent storage (like a database), then insert that data as dynamic content into the web pages that your user sees. However, Django can do much more than that. On top of the ability to pull in any existing Python libraries, Django follows a “batteries included” philosophy and comes packaged with many of the features and functionality that a developer would commonly use in their projects such as testing, authentication, multi-site support and middlewares.

To make the best use of this quickstart, it is suggested you feel comfortable with the following topics:
- Command line activities such as installation, execution with flags
- MVC application architecture
- Python3 Syntax, Python modules
- OOP principles and design
- HTTP requests
- Relational database basics
- Getting information from Web API
- HTML, CSS, JS basics
