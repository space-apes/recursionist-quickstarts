## Potential Core Stepping Stones
- requests, urls, views, static sites
    - static resources / filestructure
    - http requests
    - slugs
    - urls.py, project wide vs app-wide
    - 
- templates
    - evaluation in templates / limiting logic to views(separation of concerns)
    - generic templates
- models
    - local vs persisted vs 'instanced'!!!
    - CRUD operations
    - field types
    - relationships
- queries / querysets
    - querysets are lazy.. do not touch DB
    - chaining
- migrations
- forms
    -cross site navigation!
- djangoadmin site
    - adding to project
    - configuring
    - using
- Task/Project ideas
    - amazon clone (models, querysets, templates)
        -MODELS
            - User model
                - string: address
                - string: name
                - [string] : common search terms (maybe recommended?)
                - [Product]: previous purchases
                - [Product]: current cart
            - Product Model
                - string: description
                - real: price
                - [real]: dimensions, weight
                - [string]: urls of images
                - [Review] : list of reviews for this product
            - Review Model
                - string: review contents
                - integer: rating
                - User: user who did review
        -PAGES
            -home
            -register
            -login
            -search result
            -product
            -cart
            -checkout

    - Food Survey / food recommender (admin?)
        -MODELS
            -FoodItem
                - string: name
                - string: description
                - string: image
                - int: index
            -User
                - string: ID
                - [(integer, integer)]: foodItem index, personal rating
                - 
        -NOTES
            - maybe make this one based on sessions instead of username/password?
            - allow users to enter in new food Items
            - use admin to remove offensive/incorrect food items
            - users may not have rated all foods, but can still iterate through all foods that are in DB to find recommendations
            - recommendation ideas:
                - top 5 foodItem ratings of k nearest User neighbors
                - can make it a social media site where you browse other users
                - OR choose your own reccomendation algorithms

## Bird's Eye Structure
- Django Quickstart
    - version
    - what is django
- Installation
    - installing libraries / venv
    - installing DB
    - creating new project
        - projects vs apps
        - location of files on server
    - file structure 
    - running test server / difference between full server
- Concept1: Requests, Routes, Views, static site
    - project-wide urls vs 
    - hello world with single route that returns HttpResponse
    - link up hello world to simple view
