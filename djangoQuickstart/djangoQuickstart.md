## Potential Core Stepping Stones
- requests, urls, views, static sites
    - static resources / filestructure
    - http requests
    - HttpRequest, HttpResponse
    - slugs
    - urls.py, project wide vs app-widea
    - urlconf has urlpatterns list of paths
        - path: 
            - string: route
            - function/method reference: view
            - string: name
            - kwargs: optional dictionary of values to pass in to view
            - (dont forget passes httprequest in to view
    - "When somebody requests a page from your website – say, “/polls/34/”, Django will load the mysite.urls Python module because it’s pointed to by the ROOT_URLCONF setting. It finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the patterns in order. After finding the match at 'polls/', it strips off the matching text ("polls/") and sends the remaining text – "34/" – to the ‘polls.urls’ URLconf for further processing. There it matches '<int:question_id>/', resulting in a call to the detail() view like so"

        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/
        - using name instead of hardcoded urls
            - if multiple apps with same url names, can namespace 
                - add 'app_name = <name>' in urlsconf
                - when referencing the url, <app_name>:<urlName>
    - views
        - "A view is a “type” of Web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template."
        - 'pages' vs 'actions'?
        - goal of view is to either return an HttpResponse or raise an exception(EX: 404)
        - passing context into httpresponse

- templates
    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/templates/
    - maybe cover static resources
    - evaluation in templates / limiting logic to views(separation of concerns)
    - namespacing templates for modularity
    - loading and rendering templates in views, using django.shortcuts.render
    - error handling / 404s
    - generic templates
    - removing hardcoded URLS. using 'name' of a path instead. modularity. dont need to change url in each template, only need to update urlsconf
- models / DB (or models / DB / migrations)
    - "DRY" philosophy: models are absolute truth about data. define them in one place, derive all else from that definition.
    - adjust settings.py ('default', 'user', 'password', 'host')
    - defining models
        - fields may have optional or mandatory parameters
    - each model is a table "appName-modelName"
    - each member variable that instantiates models.Xfield is a column in table (underscore convention)

    - activate models by adding to settings.py, makemigrations, migrate (adds schema and API!), DO THIS EVERY TIME ADJUST data fields of models
    - why creating migrations separate from applying them: schema version control
    - using the shell
        - import model first
        - instantiate local object
        - CRUD operations
        - persist
        - retrieve
            - all()
            - filter(): for multiple items. no matches gives empty queryset
            - get(): for single items. no matches throws error
        - access member values
        - why to use 'shell_plus' and how to install
            - install django-extensions
            - install ipython
            - 'ipython profile create'
            - update config file
            - may need to downgrade jedi 
    - local vs persisted vs 'instanced'!!!
    - field types
    - relationships
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/relations/
        - double underscores to refer to model object that belongs to another mode object
        - one to many 
            - api access of many from one <ModelName>.<relModelName>_set.all()
        - one to one 
        - many to many
    - underscoreunderscore str underscoreunderscore method of model definitionsa
    - django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404
        - use helper function to maintain loose coupling: do not want to couple view and model layers
        - also django.shortcuts.get_list_or_404() that uses filter instead of get() and raises Http404 if list is empty
- queries / querysets
    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups-intro
    - querysets are lazy.. do not touch DB
    - ordering
    - chaining
- migrations
    - 'makemigrations' to make new migration after changing models
        - look in file to see migration
    - 'sqlmigrate' to view sql code generated for migration
    - 'migrate' to execute migration
    - 'check' to look for problems in current migration before touching db
- forms
    - cross site navigation!
    - http method review
    - 'name/value' http attributes when posting
    - request.post[<name>], use try and except on KeyError
        - request.post is a dictionary like object with key value pairs. value is always a string!
        - always redirect when posting to avoid user hitting 'back' button and submitting multiple times


- djangoadmin site
    - admin/0ligarch33
    - purpose of admin site
    - added by default (check apps)
    - manage.py createsuperuser
    - change admin.py to add certain models to admin site
        - (web interface generated from models.py!)
    - configuring
    - using
- multi-app projects, reusable apps, virtual environments
- configuring external DB server

## Task/Project ideas
- amazon clone (views, routes, models, querysets, templates)
    - Possible Educational Sequence
        - views/routes/templates
            - create basic HttpResponse views and urlpatterns for Login, Register, Search, ItemDetail, Cart,
            - create models for User, Item, use shell 
            - create querysets for different varieties of searching for items(filter, order_by, chaining)
            - create templates for each type of page
                - form template for registering 
                - template for when search is blank vs search has search terma


    - MODELS
        - User model
            - string: address
            - string: name
            - [string] : common search terms (maybe recommended?)
            - [Product]: previous purchases
            - [Product]: current cart
        - Product Model
            - string: description
            - real: price
            - [real]: dimensions, weight
            - [string]: urls of images
            - [Review] : list of reviews for this product
        - Review Model
            - string: review contents
            - integer: rating
            - User: user who did review
    -PAGES
        -home
        -register
        -login
        -search result
        -product
        -cart
        -checkout

- Food Survey / food recommender (admin?, libraries?)
    - MODELS
        - FoodItem
            - string: name
            - string: description
            - string: image
            - int: index
        -User
            - string: ID
            - [(integer, integer)]: foodItem index, personal rating
    - NOTES
        - maybe make this one based on sessions instead of username/password?
        - allow users to enter in new food Items
        - use admin to remove offensive/incorrect food items
        - users may not have rated all foods, but can still iterate through all foods that are in DB to find recommendations
        - recommendation ideas:
            - top 5 foodItem ratings of k nearest User neighbors
            - can make it a social media site where you browse other users
            - OR choose your own reccomendation algorithms

## Bird's Eye Structure
- Django Quickstart
    - version
    - what is django
    - requirements
        - OOP
        - 'coupling' 
        - helps to understand python modules, html, css, db basics
        - model view controller architecture
    - a note on content: some concepts fall across earlier stepping stones and will appear in multiple places.. something like this...
    - a note on workflow: it may help to have many windows open at same time...(image of example workflow)
- Installation
    - installing libraries / venv
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
    - installing DB
    - creating new project
        - projects vs apps
        - location of files on servera
        - default apps
    - file structure
    - manage.py -h  
    - running test server / difference between full server
    - running remotely
    - settings.py, 'disallowed host', timezone 
    - creating app, adding app to project apps in settings
- Concept1: Requests, Routes, Views, static site
    - project-wide urlsconf vs app specific
    - greedy match on urlpattern route
    - hello world with single route that returns HttpResponse
    - link up hello world to simple view
- Challenge 1
- Concept 2 Models / DB / Dynamic content
    - 'model is definitive truth about data': fields, behavior, db schema, API calls on models
- Challenge 2
