## Potential Core Stepping Stones
- requests, urls, views, static sites
    - static resources / filestructure
    - http requests
    - slugs
    - urls.py, project wide vs app-wide
- templates
    - evaluation in templates / limiting logic to views(separation of concerns)
    - generic templates
- models / DB
    - each model is a table "appName-modelName"
    - each member variable that instantiates models.Xfield is a column in table (underscore convention)

    - activate models by adding to settings.py, migrate (adds schema and API!)
    - using the shell
        - import model first
        - instantiate local object
        - persist
        - retrieve
        - access member values
    - local vs persisted vs 'instanced'!!!
    - CRUD operations
    - field types
    - relationships
        - one to many 
        - one to one 
        - many to many
- queries / querysets
    - querysets are lazy.. do not touch DB
    - chaining
- migrations
    - 'makemigrations' to make new migration after changing models
        - look in file to see migration
    - 'sqlmigrate' to view sql code generated for migration
    - 'migrate' to execute migration
    - 'check' to look for problems in current migration before touching db
- forms
    -cross site navigation!
- djangoadmin site
    - adding to project
    - configuring
    - using
- multi-app projects, reusable apps, virtual environments
- configuring external DB server

## Task/Project ideas
    - amazon clone (models, querysets, templates)
        - MODELS
            - User model
                - string: address
                - string: name
                - [string] : common search terms (maybe recommended?)
                - [Product]: previous purchases
                - [Product]: current cart
            - Product Model
                - string: description
                - real: price
                - [real]: dimensions, weight
                - [string]: urls of images
                - [Review] : list of reviews for this product
            - Review Model
                - string: review contents
                - integer: rating
                - User: user who did review
        -PAGES
            -home
            -register
            -login
            -search result
            -product
            -cart
            -checkout

    - Food Survey / food recommender (admin?)
        - MODELS
            - FoodItem
                - string: name
                - string: description
                - string: image
                - int: index
            -User
                - string: ID
                - [(integer, integer)]: foodItem index, personal rating
        - NOTES
            - maybe make this one based on sessions instead of username/password?
            - allow users to enter in new food Items
            - use admin to remove offensive/incorrect food items
            - users may not have rated all foods, but can still iterate through all foods that are in DB to find recommendations
            - recommendation ideas:
                - top 5 foodItem ratings of k nearest User neighbors
                - can make it a social media site where you browse other users
                - OR choose your own reccomendation algorithms

## Bird's Eye Structure
- Django Quickstart
    - version
    - what is django
    - requirements
        - OOP
        - helps to understand python modules, html, css, db basics
        - model view controller architecture
- Installation
    - installing libraries / venv
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
    - installing DB
    - creating new project
        - projects vs apps
        - location of files on servera
        - default apps
    - file structure
    - manage.py -h  
    - running test server / difference between full server
    - running remotely
    - 'disallowed host' 
    - creating app, adding app to project apps in settings
- Concept1: Requests, Routes, Views, static site
    - project-wide urlsconf vs app specific
    - greedy match on urlpattern route
    - hello world with single route that returns HttpResponse
    - link up hello world to simple view
- Challenge 1
- Concept 2 Models / DB / Dynamic content
    - 'model is definitive truth about data': fields, behavior, db schema
